Suppose that there exists an invertible linear map $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ such that $Tu=Su$ for all $u \in U$.  
Also, suppose S is not injective. Then, there exists some $u \in U$ such that $Su=0$ and $u \neq 0$. Then, since $T$ is invertible and $Tu=Su=0$. Applying $T^{-1}$ implies $u = 0$, contradicting the assumption that $u \neq 0$.

Suppose that $S$ is injective.  
Let $u_1,\dots,u_m$ be a basis of $U$.  
Let $c_1u_1+\dots+c_mu_m = 0$, where $c_1=\dots=c_m=0$.  
Applying $S$, $c_1Su_1+\dots+c_mSu_m=0$. Thus, $Su_1,\dots,Su_m$ is linearly independent, $Su_i \in V$. We can extend $Su_1,\dots,Su_m$ to a basis of V, $Su_1,\dots,Su_m,v_{m+1},\dots,v_{m+n}$.  
Define $T$ on the basis of $V$,
$$\begin{align*}
Tu_i &= Su_i \qquad \text{for $i=1,\dots,m$} \\
Tv_i &= v_{m+1} \qquad \text{for $i = m+1,\dots,n$}
\end{align*}$$
Thus, by construction, $T$ is linear and invertible. Hence, $Tu=Su$, as desired.

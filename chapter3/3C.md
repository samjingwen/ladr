$\text{range }T$ represents the number of basis vectors in $V$ that are mapped to linearly independent vectors in $W$. Therefore, $\text{range }T$ corresponds to the number of linearly independent columns in $M(T)$.

There are at least $\text{range }T$ linearly independent columns in $M(T)$, and these columns must have at least one nonzero entry. If a column had all zero entries, this would imply that the corresponding basis vector in $V$ is mapped to the zero vector in $W$, which imply that the vector is in $\text{null }T$, reducing $\text{dim range }T$.

Thus, $M(T)$ must have at least $\text{dim range }T$ nonzero entries.

### a.
Suppose $S,T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. 
Let $M(S) = A$, $M(T) = B$

For each $v_k \in V$,
$$
S(v_k) = \sum_{j=1}^{m}A_{jk}w_j
$$

Similarly for $T$,
$$
T(v_k) = \sum_{j=1}^{m}B_{jk}w_j
$$

Applying $(S+T)$ to each $v_k$,
$$\begin{align*}
(S+T)(v_k) &= S(v_k)+T(v_k) \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{m}A_{jk}w_j+\sum_{j=1}^{m}B_{jk}w_j \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{m}(A_{jk}+B_{jk})w_j
\end{align*}$$

Thus, $M(S+T)$ is the $m$ by $n$ matrix whose entry in row $j$, column $k$ is equals $A_{jk}+B_{jk}$, as desired.

### b.
Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. 
Let $M(T) = A$.

For each $v_k \in V$,
$$
T(v_k) = \sum_{j=1}^{m}A_{jk}w_j
$$

Applying $\lambda T$ to each $v_k$,
$$\begin{align*}
(\lambda T)(v_k) &= T(\lambda v_k) \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{m}A_{jk}(\lambda w_j) \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{m}(\lambda A_{jk})w_j \\
\end{align*}$$

Thus, $M(\lambda T)$ is the $m$ by $n$ matrix whose entry in row $j$, column $k$ is equals $\lambda A_{jk}$, as desired.

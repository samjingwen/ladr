$\text{range }T$ represents the number of basis vectors in $V$ that are mapped to linearly independent vectors in $W$. Therefore, $\text{range }T$ corresponds to the number of linearly independent columns in $M(T)$.

There are at least $\text{range }T$ linearly independent columns in $M(T)$, and these columns must have at least one nonzero entry. If a column had all zero entries, this would imply that the corresponding basis vector in $V$ is mapped to the zero vector in $W$, which imply that the vector is in $\text{null }T$, reducing $\text{dim range }T$.

Thus, $M(T)$ must have at least $\text{dim range }T$ nonzero entries.
